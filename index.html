          I was born in Batangas, Philippines and moved to the USA when I was 11.
          I put myself through school while supporting my parents. I pursued my father's
          dream of being an engineer on a whim and started learning to code freshman year
          of college. I definitely did not see myself coding for a career, but here I am!
          I found a love for coding through robotics courses I took in
          <a href = "https://www.mesacc.edu/">Mesa Community College</a>
          and followed that with more advanced disciplines at
          <a href="https://www.asu.edu/">Arizona State University.</a>
          After graduation, I got a job at ITC in Tempe, AZ.

        <h1>Experience</h1>
        <p>
          The company I work for produces machines that runs different types of tests on probe cards. I currently maintain
          the native code that runs on our first gen machine. The language used here is CPP.
          And my day-to-day? It is normally just me checking Jira
          for any bugs and features our customers report and/or our field services. After a bug
          or feature is implemented, I create release via InstallShield program, which is then
          tested by our field service manager before it goes out to customers. Currently,
          I've been working on a program that reads csv files for a motherboard configuration
          and translates the edges and channels to a formatted display that will assist in
          connecting towers to pads with flex cables. This program is written in C#. I am also working on building
          a new help system for our main machine. This
          will use generated XML files and display via html and will only by use by employess within
          the company.

        <h1>Hobbies</h1>
        Im not sure if this is considered a hobby or just a lifestyle, but I love staying home and
        finding old shows to watch. I've been an avid anime fan since I was young, and recently I've been
        getting back to watching my old favorites. I also love to spend my time going out to eat. I've been
        really into steak houses a lot, and brunch! And to be completely honest, if I'm not out, then
        I am usually doing absolutely nothing. This is normally on the weekends. Since work usually burns me out
        during the week, I tend to let go and relax completely by just laying down on my bed.
        <br><br>In the future, I plan to be more involved with coding after my work hours.
