    My name is Kristina. I was born in the Philippines and moved to AZ, USA when I was 11.
    I continued my education here and found my love for programming.
    After graduation, I got my first job at Integrated Technology Corp.,
    which is a small company down in Tempe, Az. I am currently 1 of the 2 software engineer
    in this company which makes everything a bit more challenging than I had hope for my first job.
    Nevertheless, every day is pretty fun! I definitely enjoy learning about what other people do,
    and of course programming.

  <section id="exp" class = "cards">
    The company I work for produces machines that runs different types of tests on probe cards. I currently maintain
    the native code that runs on our first gen machine. The language used here is CPP.
    And my day-to-day? It is normally just me checking Jira
    for any bugs and features our customers report and/or our field services. After a bug
    or feature is implemented, I create release via InstallShield program, which is then
    tested by our field service manager before it goes out to customers. Currently,
    I've been working on a program that reads csv files for a motherboard configuration
    and translates the edges and channels to a formatted display that will assist in
    connecting towers to pads with flex cables. This program is written in C#. I am also working on building a new help system for our main machine. This
    will use generated XML files and display via html.

    Im not sure if this is considered a hobby or just a lifestyle, but I love staying home and
    finding old shows to watch. I've been an avid anime fan since I was young, and recently I've been
    getting back to watching my old favorites. I also love to spend my time going out to eat. I've been
    really into steak houses a lot, and brunch! And to be completely honest, if I'm not out, then
    I am usually doing absolutely nothing. This is normally on the weekends. Since work usually burns me out
    during the week, I tend to let go and relax completely by just laying down on my bed.

    <br><br>In the future, I plan to be more involved with coding after my work hours.
