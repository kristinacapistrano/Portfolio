    <br>Hello, my name is Kristina Capistrano. I am software developer with a focus on creating desktop applications for semiconductor test machines.</br
    <br>This is my first job in this field and everything has been a great learning experience.
      I am currently expanding to front end level development, and this portfolio is the first small project I am working on.</br>

    This is just another test section where i want to put all the projects i have worked on so far.
    I don't have much to show on this area since i've only been doing professional work since
    I graduated. All the projects i have worked on so far are really from college. What
    I currently work on in the office is continous integration and continous deployment.
