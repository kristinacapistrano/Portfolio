    <br>Hello, my name is Kristina Capistrano. I am software developer with a focus on creating desktop applications
    for semiconductor test machines.
    <br>This is my first job in this field and everything has been a great learning experience.
    I am currently expanding to front end level development, and this portfolio is the first small project I am working on.

      This is just another test section where I want to put all the projects i have worked on so far.
      I don't have much to show on this area since I've only been doing professional work since
      I graduated. All the projects I have worked on so far are really from college. What
      I currently work on in the office is continuous integration and continuous deployment.
